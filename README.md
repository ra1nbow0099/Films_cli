## Architecture explanation

The application is made to store information about movies, add new movies, delete movies and search for movies by name and actors.

To create an application, I used the following technologies:
1. Node.js and express framework for back-end
2. REST api to handle requests
3. Commander to make cli
4. MongoDB for data storage
